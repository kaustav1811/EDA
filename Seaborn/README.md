I have used the Iris dataset to practice and gain a better knowledge of the visualization capabilities of the Seaborn library. I have used a variety of Seaborn plots in this notebook, such as:

Heatmap: To show how several number columns relate to one another.

Jointplot: This method uses density and scatter plots to examine the relationship between two variables.

Pairplot: To show the dataset's features in pairwise relationships.

To see how a single variable is distributed, I used a distplot.

To display the frequency distribution of categorical data, I used a countplot.

Barplot: To compare numerical values with category data.

Boxplot: To see how data is distributed and find anomalies.

Violinplot: To create a comprehensive distribution view, combine KDE with boxplot.

This study aids in comprehending the correlations between the dataset's various columns and how data is distributed. The goal was to explore the dataset while learning and practicing Seabornâ€™s functionality for effective data visualization.
